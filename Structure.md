# Frontend - Backend

The structure in the backend and the frontend has been written to be
`testable, maintainable, and extensible.`

## `Extensible`

The structure in the folder and the naming conventions allow the project to be extensible adding more features, routes in the backend, and components in the frontend, always keeping the logic aside allowing to extend the project in an organized way.

## `Maintainable`

Is maintainable because is separated into small modules that have specific functions that are easier to identify where you wanna do a change or wanna fix some things.

## `Testable`

Because the logic is separated, makes it easier to do the unit test. In the backend is important to test the routes and the services of these routes, that have the logic to retrieve or add data to the database.

Same in the front end having the logic that retrieves and adds components to the database, separated from the component, allows to make the unit test easier and organized.
